## PRICING JUSTIFICATION

### Why ₹6/kWh is Fair

**Your Costs (Estimated):**
- Electricity procurement: ₹4-4.5/kWh
- Station OPEX (maintenance, rent): ₹1/kWh
- Amortized CAPEX: ₹0.5/kWh
- **Total cost:** ~₹5.5-6/kWh

**At ₹6/kWh:**
- You still make margin (albeit lower than retail)
- Volume compensates for lower margin
- Predictable income reduces risk

**Our Math:**
- Retail rate: ₹10/kWh
- Our bulk rate: ₹6/kWh
- Our savings: 40%
- **Sustainable for both parties**

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### What if we don't meet volume commitments?

**Proposed Clause:**
- If monthly usage <80% of committed volume for 2 consecutive months
- We pay shortfall at ₹5/kWh (not ₹6/kWh)
- Example: Committed 500 kWh, used only 300 kWh
- We pay: (300 × ₹6) + (200 × ₹5) = ₹1,800 + ₹1,000 = ₹2,800

**Your Protection:** You get minimum revenue even if we underperform.

### What if rates change?

**Proposed Clause:**
- Locked-in pricing for 12 months
- Annual review at contract renewal
- Rate adjustments only if electricity tariff changes >15%
- Both parties agree to fair re-negotiation

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: What if you go out of business?**  
A: We're building a profitable business (15% margins Month 1). Not VC-funded burn. Low risk.

A: Yes, 60-day notice. But we're committed to making this work long-term.

**Q: What about exclusivity?**  
A: We prefer [PARTNER] as primary, but won't commit to 100% exclusivity in Month 1. Let's prove the model first, then discuss.
